************************

The modules listed here are part of the CMake Modules Collection. Projects
may provide further modules; their location(s) can be specified in the
:cmake:variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH <cmake:variable:CMAKE_MODULE_PATH>` variable.

These modules are loaded using the :cmake:command:`include() <cmake:command:include()>`
command. They provide a single public function responsible for dispatching
multiple operations, internally using private macros. Only one public command
is exposed per module.
