This collection of CMake modules provides macros and functions that extend official functionality or wrap it in higher-level abstractions to make writing CMake code faster and easier. Each module is documented and tested using the unit-testing framework [CMakeTest](https://github.com/CMakePP/CMakeTest).

## ✨ Features

- Modern CMake code.
- Well-documented for ease of use.
- Reliable code thanks to extensive unit testing, written using [CMakeTest](https://github.com/CMakePP/CMakeTest).
- A coding and documentation style similar to official CMake modules.

## ⚓ Requirements

The following dependencies are **required** for development and must be installed:

- **CMake v3.20+** - can be found [here](https://cmake.org/).
- **C++ compiler** (any version) - e.g., [GCC v15.2+](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Clang C++ v19.1.3+](https://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html) or [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

## 💫 Module overview

### Module structure

**Note**: Before proceeding, it is recommended to understand the [difference between a function and a macro](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/macro.html#macro-vs-function) in CMake.

A module is a text file with the `.cmake` extension that provides a [CMake command](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html) for performing various types of data manipulation within a build project.

There are two types of modules, distinguished by a prefix in the filename:

- The ***Function*-type** module, prefixed with `Func`, provide a single public function responsible for dispatching multiple operations, internally using private macros. Only one public command is exposed per module.
- The ***Bundle*-type** module, prefixed with `Bundle`, contains a set of functions and macros designed to operate on a common object, in a way that reflects object-oriented programming. Each function defines a separate command, and a module may include multiple commands.

The general format of a module filename is `<Func|Bundle><module-name>.cmake`, where `<module-name>` uses PascalCase (also called UpperCamelCase), e.g., `StringManip`.

In the "public" interface of modules, CMake `function()` are preferred over `macro()` due to better encapsulation and its own variable scope.

The public function of a *Function*-type module follows a **signature and call pattern** identical to what is found in official CMake [modules](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-modules.7.html) and [commands](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-commands.7.html), such as the [`string()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/string.html) command:

```cmake
<command-name>(<operation-name> [<option>|<options>...] [<input-params>...] [<output-params>...])
```

where :

- `<command-name>`: the name of the single command defined by the module, written entirely in lowercase with words separated by `_`, e.g. `print`, `string_manip`.
- `<operation-name>`: the name of the operation to be performed by the command, written entirely in uppercase with words separated by `_`, e.g. `SPLIT`, `EXTRACT_INTERFACE`.
- `[<option>|<options>...]`: a value, a list of values, or a [*variable reference*](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references) passed as an argument to the command, e.g. `file_manip(STRIP_PATH "path/to/file")`, `file_manip(STRIP_PATH MY_FILE_PATH)`
- `[<input-params>...]`: read-only input parameters in the form:
  - `input-param ::= <constant> [<var-ref>|<value>|<values>...]`: where a parameter is either a keyword or a pair combining a keyword with a value, a list of values, or a [*variable reference*](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references).
- `[<output-params>...]`: write-only output parameters in the form:
  - `output-param ::= <constant> [<var-ref>|<value>|<values>...]`: where a parameter is either a keyword or a pair combining a keyword with a value, a list of values, or a [*variable reference*](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references).

The structure of this function signature results from the use of the CMake command `cmake_parse_arguments` to parse the function's arguments. The official [command documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/cmake_parse_arguments.html) provides further explanations on the concepts mentioned above.

Within the public function of a module, the first parameter `<operation-name>` acts as a **dispatcher**, routing the execution flow to the internal macro that implements the requested operation. Therefore, the function’s role is limited to parsing arguments, initializing scoped variables, and calling an internal macro.

Regarding **module documentation**, just like the code follows a style consistent with official CMake conventions, the documentation also aims to follow the [*CMake Documentation Guide*](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Help/dev/documentation.rst). It is written in *reStructuredText* format and placed at the top of the file.
