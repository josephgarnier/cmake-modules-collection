Dependency
----------

Operations to manipule dependencies. They mainly encapsulate the numerous
function calls required to
:cmake:guide:`import and export dependencies <guide:Importing and Exporting Guide>`.
It requires CMake 4.0.1 or newer.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

.. parsed-literal::

  dependency(`BUILD`_ <lib-target-name> [...])
  dependency(`IMPORT`_ <lib-target-name> [...])
  dependency(`ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`_ <lib-target-name> <SET|APPEND> INTERFACE <gen-expr>...)
  dependency(`SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION`_ <lib-target-name> [CONFIGURATION <config-type>] INTERFACE <gen-expr>...)
  dependency(`EXPORT`_ <lib-target-name>... <BUILD_TREE|INSTALL_TREE> [APPEND] OUTPUT_FILE <file-name>)

Usage
^^^^^

.. signature::
  dependency(BUILD <target-name> [...])

  Build a dependency from source:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    dependency(BUILD <target-name>
               TYPE <STATIC|SHARED|HEADER|EXEC>
               [COMPILE_FEATURES <feature>...]
               [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <definition>...]
               [COMPILE_OPTIONS <option>...]
               [LINK_OPTIONS <option>...]
               DEP_DIR <dir-path>
               SOURCE_FILES [<*>|<file-path>...]
               HEADER_FILES [<*>|<file-path>...]
               [INCLUDE_DIRS <dir-path>...|<gen-expr>...]
               [LINK_LIBRARIES <target-name>...|<gen-expr>...]
               [DEPENDENCIES <target-dependency-name>...]
               [EXPORT_HEADERS <*>|<file-path>...]
               [EXPORT_EXTRA_SOURCES <*>|<file-path>...])

  Creates the binary target ``<target-name>`` of type ``STATIC``, ``SHARED``,
  ``HEADER``, or ``EXEC``. The target is generated from the files listed under
  ``SOURCE_FILES`` and ``HEADER_FILES`` located inside the directory specified
  by ``DEP_DIR``. All file and directory paths must be relative to this
  dependency root directory.

  The options are:

    ``<target-name>``: (required)
      The *unique* name of the build target.

    ``TYPE <STATIC|SHARED|HEADER|EXEC>``: (required)
      The actual target type to build. The valid values are: ``STATIC``,
      ``SHARED``, ``HEADER``, and ``EXEC``.

    ``COMPILE_FEATURES <feature>...``: (optional)
      A list of compile features to pass to the target. Example:
      ``["cxx_std_20", "cxx_thread_local", "cxx_trailing_return_types"]``.

    ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <definition>...``: (optional)
      A list of preprocessor definitions applied when compiling the target.
      Example: ``["DEFINE_ONE=1", "DEFINE_TWO=2", "OPTION_1"]``.

    ``COMPILE_OPTIONS <option>...``: (optional)
      A list of compiler options to pass when building the target. Example:
      ``["-Wall", "-Wextra", "/W4"]``.

    ``LINK_OPTIONS <option>...``: (optional)
      A list of linker options to pass when building the target. Example:
      ``["-s", "-z", "/INCREMENTAL:NO"]``.

    ``DEP_DIR <dir-path>``: (required)
      The path to the directory containing all dependency files. Any relative
      path is treated as relative to the current source directory (i.e.
      :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR <cmake:variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR>`).
      This path will be used as base directory for all other paths of this
      command.

    ``SOURCE_FILES <*>|<file-path>...``: (required)
      The list of source files (e.g., ``.cpp``, ``.c``) to use when building
      the target. All paths must be relative to the dependency root directory
      ``DEP_DIR``. The list can be empty, especially for header-only
      dependencies. A wildcard ``*`` may be used to automatically collect all
      ``.cpp``, ``.cc``, or ``.cxx`` files recursively from ``DEP_DIR``.

    ``HEADER_FILES <*>|<file-path>...``: (required)
      The list of header files (e.g., ``.h``) to use when building the target.
      All paths must be relative to the dependency root directory
      ``DEP_DIR``. The list can be empty, especially for header-only
      dependencies. A wildcard ``*`` may be used to automatically collect all
      ``.h``, ``.hpp``, ``.hxx``, ``.inl``, or ``.tpp`` files recursively from
      ``DEP_DIR``.

    ``INCLUDE_DIRS <dir-path>...|<gen-expr>...``: (optional)
      Include directories added to the target with ``PRIVATE`` visibility.
      Paths must be relative to ``DEP_DIR``. Generator expressions may be used
      with the syntax ``$<...>``.

    ``LINK_LIBRARIES <target-name>...|<gen-expr>...``: (optional)
      The list of libraries that the target should be linked with. They can be
      target names or generator expressions with the syntax ``$<...>``.

    ``DEPENDENCIES <target-dependency-name>...``: (optional)
      The list of targets on which ``<target-name>`` depends on and that must
      be built before.

    ``EXPORT_HEADERS <*>|<file-path>...``: (optional)
      The set of header files copied at install time from the source-tree to
      the install-tree. These headers become available for inclusion to the
      source files in all targets that transitively depend on it. If ``*`` is
      used, files with the extensions ``.h``, ``.hpp``, ``.hxx``, ``.inl``, or
      ``.tpp`` are collected recursively from the directories listed in
      ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` when present, otherwise from ``DEP_DIR``.

      During installation, the directory structure is copied verbatim to the
      standards-conforming location:
      ``<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/<CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR>/<PROJECT_NAME>/lib/<DEP_DIR_NAME>``

    ``EXPORT_EXTRA_SOURCES <*>|<file-path>...``: (optional)
      The set of additional source files copied at install time from the source
      -tree to the install-tree. These files become available for inclusion to the
      source files in all targets that transitively depend on it. If ``*`` is
      used, files are collected recursively from the directories listed in
      ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` when present, otherwise from ``DEP_DIR``. When both
      ``EXPORT_HEADERS`` and ``EXPORT_EXTRA_SOURCES`` are used, any duplicated
      paths found in ``EXPORT_EXTRA_SOURCES`` are removed. 

      During installation, the directory structure is copied verbatim to the
      standards-conforming location:
      ``<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/<CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR>/<PROJECT_NAME>/lib/<DEP_DIR_NAME>``

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    # Build a shared lib dependency
    dependency(BUILD "my_shared_lib"
      TYPE SHARED
      COMPILE_FEATURES "cxx_std_20" "cxx_thread_local" "cxx_trailing_return_types"
      COMPILE_DEFINITIONS "DEFINE_ONE=1" "DEFINE_TWO=2" "OPTION_1"
      COMPILE_OPTIONS "-Wall" "-Wextra"
      LINK_OPTIONS "-s" "-z"
      DEP_DIR "lib/my_shared_lib"
      SOURCE_FILES "src/main.cpp" "src/util.cpp" "src/source_1.cpp"
      HEADER_FILES "src/util.h" "src/source_1.h" "include/lib_1.h" "include/lib_2.h"
      INCLUDE_DIRS "include"
      LINK_LIBRARIES "dep_1" "dep_2"
      DEPENDENCIES "dep_3"
      EXPORT_HEADERS "*"
      EXPORT_EXTRA_SOURCES "my_shared_lib.cpp")

.. signature::
  dependency(IMPORT <lib-target-name> [...])

  Import a depedency:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    dependency(IMPORT <lib-target-name>
               TYPE <STATIC|SHARED>
               FIND_ROOT_DIR <dir-path>
               [FIND_RELEASE_FILE <lib-file-basename>]
               [FIND_DEBUG_FILE <lib-file-basename>])

  Create an imported library target named ``<lib-target-name>`` by locating its
  binary files in ``FIND_ROOT_DIR`` for ``RELEASE`` and/or ``DEBUG``, and set
  the necessary target properties. An aliased target is also created with the
  name ``<lib-target-name>::<lib-target-name>``.

  This command combines calls to :command:`directory(FIND_LIB)`,
  :cmake:command:`add_library(IMPORTED) <cmake:command:add_library(imported)>` and
  :cmake:command:`set_target_properties() <cmake:command:set_target_properties()>`.
  Its main purpose is to manually import a target from a package that does not
  provide a generated import script for the build-tree (with
  :cmake:command:`export(TARGETS) <cmake:command:export(targets)>`) or
  the install-tree (with :cmake:command:`install(EXPORT) <cmake:command:install(export)>`).

  The command requires a ``TYPE`` value to specify the type of library (
  ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED``). At least one of ``FIND_RELEASE_FILE <lib-file-basename>``
  or ``FIND_DEBUG_FILE <lib-file-basename>`` must be provided. Both can be used.
  These arguments determine which configurations of the library will be
  available, typically matching values in the
  :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES <cmake:variable:CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES>` variable.

  The value of ``<lib-file-basename>`` should have no extension or prefixes; it
  should be the core name of the library file, stripped of:

  * Platform-specific prefixes (e.g. ``lib``).
  * Platform-specific extension suffixes (e.g. ``.so``, ``.dll``, ``.dll.a``,
    ``.a``, ``.lib``).

  The file will be resolved by scanning recursively all files in the given
  ``FIND_ROOT_DIR`` and attempting to match against expected filename patterns
  constructed using the relevant ``CMAKE_<CONFIG>_LIBRARY_PREFIX`` and
  ``CMAKE_<CONFIG>_LIBRARY_SUFFIX``, accounting for platform conventions
  and possible version-number noise in filenames. More specifically, it tries
  to do a matching between the ``<lib-file-basename>`` in format
  ``<CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX|CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX><lib-file-basename>
  <verions-numbers><CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX|CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX>``
  and each filename found striped from their numeric and special character
  version and their suffix and their prefix based on the plateform and the
  kind of library ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED``. See the command module
  :command:`directory(FIND_LIB)`, that is used internally, for full details.

  An error is raised if more than one file matches or no file is found.

  Once located, an imported target is created using :cmake:command:`add_library(IMPORTED) <cmake:command:add_library(imported)>` and
  appropriate properties for each available configuration (``RELEASE`` and/or
  ``DEBUG``) are set, including paths to the binary and import libraries (if
  applicable), as well as the soname.

  The following target properties are configured:

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
      Set to an empty value. This property defines the include directories as
      a usage requirement to consumers of the imported target, so that it is
      automatically added to their header search paths when they link against
      it.

      In this context, the value is intended for source-tree usage, meaning
      that the directory path refers to headers available directly in the
      project source (rather than in an installed or exported package). See the
      `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.html>`__
      for full details. Use :command:`dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)` to
      populate this property.

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BUILD``
      Set to an empty value. This is a *custom property*, not used by CMake
      natively, intended to track include directories for usage from the
      build-tree context. Use :command:`dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)` to
      populate this property.

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_INSTALL``
      Set to an empty value. This is a *custom property* intended for tracking
      include paths during installation or packaging, for usage from the
      install-tree context. Use :command:`dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)` to
      populate this property.

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>``
      The full path to the actual library file (e.g. ``.so``, ``.dll``, ``.a``, ``.lib``),
      set separately for each configuration (``RELEASE`` and/or ``DEBUG``). See the `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_LOCATION_CONFIG.html>`__ for full details.

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_BUILD_<CONFIG>``
      *Custom property* set to an empty value. Intended for build-tree specific
      overrides of the library path, for usage from the build-tree context.
      Use :command:`dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION)` to initialize this property.

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_INSTALL_<CONFIG>``
      *Custom property* set to an empty value. Intended for install-time
      overrides of the library path, for usage from the install-tree context.
      Use :command:`dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION)` to initialize this property.

    ``IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>``
      On DLL-based platforms (e.g. Windows), set to the full path of the
      import library file (e.g. ``.dll.a``, ``.a``, ``.lib``) for the corresponding
      configuration. For static libraries, this property is set to empty,
      because an import library is only for a shared library. See the
      `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_IMPLIB_CONFIG.html>`__ for full details.

    ``IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>``
      Set to the filename of the resolved library (without path), allowing
      CMake to handle runtime linking and version resolution. See the
      `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_SONAME_CONFIG.html>`__ for full details.

    ``IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS``
      Appended with each configuration for which a library was found and
      configured (e.g. ``RELEASE``, ``DEBUG``). See the `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS.html>`__ for full
      details.

  To provide maximum flexibility when importing a library with this command, it
  mirrors CMake's official requirements for ``FindXxx.cmake`` modules by
  initializing the
  :cmake:ref:`requires standard variables <cmake developer standard variable names>`.
  It also supports use in multiples :cmake:ref:`build configurations` contexts
  by replicating the behavior of the
  :cmake:module:`SelectLibraryConfigurations <cmake:module:SelectLibraryConfigurations>`
  module.

  This command then returns the following result variables:

    ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_RELEASE``
      The full absolute path to the ``Release`` build of the library. If no
      file found, its value is set to
      ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND``. The variable is undefined
      when the ``FIND_RELEASE_FILE`` argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
      The full absolute path to the ``Debug`` build of the library. If no
      file found, its value is set to
      ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND``. The variable is undefined
      when the ``FIND_DEBUG_FILE`` argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_RELEASE``
      The full absolute path to the ``Release`` import build of the library. If
      no file found, its value is set to
      ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND``. The variable is
      undefined when the ``FIND_RELEASE_FILE`` argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
      The full absolute path to the ``Debug`` import build of the library. If
      no file found, its value is set to
      ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND``. The variable is
      undefined when the ``FIND_DEBUG_FILE`` argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_RELEASE``
      Set to true if the ``Release`` library and import library has been found
      successfully, otherwise set to false. To be true, both
      ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` and
      ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` must not be set to
      ``-NOTFOUND``. The variable is undefined when the ``FIND_RELEASE_FILE``
      argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_DEBUG``
      Set to true if the ``Debug`` library and import library has been found
      successfully, otherwise set to false. To be true, both
      ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` and
      ``<lib-target-name>_IMP_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` must not be set to
      ``-NOTFOUND``. The variable is undefined when the ``FIND_DEBUG_FILE``
      argument is not provided.

    ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND``
      Set to false if ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_RELEASE`` or
      ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_DEBUG`` are defined and set to false. Otherwise,
      set to true.

    ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY``
      The value of ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` variable if found,
      otherwise it is set to the value of ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
      variable if found. If both are found, the release library value takes
      precedence. If both are not found, because
      ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_RELEASE`` and ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND_DEBUG``
      are set to false, it is set to value ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY-NOTFOUND``.

      If the :cmake:manual:`CMake Generator <cmake:manual:cmake-generators(7)>`
      in use supports build configurations, then this variable will be a list
      of found libraries each prepended with the ``optimized`` or ``debug``
      keywords specifying which library should be linked for the given
      configuration.  These keywords are used by the
      :cmake:command:`target_link_libraries() <cmake:command:target_link_libraries>`
      command. If a build configuration has not been set or the generator in
      use does not support build configurations, then this variable value will
      not contain these keywords.

    ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARIES``
      The same value as the ``<lib-target-name>_LIBRARY`` variable.

    ``<lib-target-name>_ROOT_DIR``
      The base directory absolute path where to look for the
      ``<lib-target-name>`` files. The value is set to the ``FIND_ROOT_DIR``
      argument.

  No library is added if ``<lib-target-name>_FOUND`` is set to false.

.. signature::
  dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES <lib-target-name> <SET|APPEND> INTERFACE <gen-expr>...)

  Set or append interface include directories required by the imported target
  ``<lib-target-name>`` to expose its headers to consumers. It specifies the
  list of directories published as usage requirements to consumers, and which
  are added to the compiler's header search path when another target links
  against it. In practice, this ensures that any consumer of the imported
  library automatically receives the correct include paths needed to compile
  against its headers.

  This command populate the target's :cmake:prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES <cmake:prop_tgt:INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>`
  property and its derivatives to allow the target to be imported from the
  three contexts: source-tree, build-tree, and install-tree.

  This command copies the behavior of
  :cmake:command:`target_include_directories() <cmake:command:target_include_directories>`
  in CMake, but introduces a separation between build-time and install-time
  contexts for imported dependencies.

  This command is intended for targets that have been previously declared
  using :command:`dependency(IMPORT)`, and is typically used in conjunction
  with :command:`dependency(EXPORT)` to complete the definition of
  an imported target for external reuse. It fills in target properties that
  are used when generating the export script. Therefore, there is no benefit
  in calling it if the target is not intended to be exported.

  The behavior differs from standard CMake in that it stores build and install
  include paths separately using generator expressions (see
  :cmake:ref:`how to write build specification with generator expressions <include directories and usage requirements>`).

  The ``INTERFACE`` visibility keyword indicates how the specified directories
  apply to the usage requirements of the target: they will not be used by the
  imported target but propagated to its consumers. The directories following it
  **must use generator expressions** like ``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>`` and
  ``$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>`` to distinguish between build and install phases.

  The command accepts the following mutually exclusive modifiers:

  * ``SET``: Replaces any existing include directories.
  * ``APPEND``: Adds to the current list of include directories.

  This command internally sets or appends the following CMake properties on the target:

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
      This standard CMake target property specifies the public include
      directories for the imported target. These directories define the usage
      requirements of the target and are automatically propagated to any
      consuming target that links against it.

      This property is populated from the ``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>``
      portion of the arguments, corresponding to the directories available
      in the source-tree context. This ensures that when a target consumes the
      imported library during a build, it automatically receives the correct
      include paths for compilation.

      See the `CMake doc
      <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES.html>`__ for full details.

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BUILD``
      A *custom property* defined by this module to track the include
      directories used in the build-tree context. It contains the fully
      expanded list of directories extracted from the ``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>``
      generator expressions. This ensures that when a target consumes the
      imported library during the build, it correctly receives all necessary
      include paths even before installation.

    ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_INSTALL``
      A *custom property* defined by this module to track the include
      directories intended for use in the install-tree context. It contains
      the fully expanded list of directories extracted from the
      ``$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>`` generator expressions. This ensures that
      after installation, any consumer of the imported library will have the
      correct include paths set for compilation against the installed headers.

  These custom properties (`_BUILD` and `_INSTALL`) are not directly used by
  CMake itself but are later re-injected into export files generated by
  :command:`dependency(EXPORT)`.

  To provide maximum flexibility when manaing a library with this module, this
  command mirrors CMake's official requirements for ``FindXxx.cmake`` modules
  by initializing a part of some
  :cmake:ref:`requires standard variables <cmake developer standard variable names>`.

  This command then returns the following result variables:

    ``<lib-target-name>_INCLUDE_DIR``
      The base directory absolute path where to find headers for using the
      library (or more accurately, the path that consumers of the library
      should add to their header search path).

    ``<lib-target-name>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
      The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by
      client code.

  .. note::

    The ``dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)`` command should be called after
    importing the target with :command:`dependency(IMPORT)` to ensure that
    the target properties and result variables are set correctly.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    # Import libs
    dependency(IMPORT "my_shared_lib"
      TYPE SHARED
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )
    dependency(IMPORT "my_static_lib"
      TYPE STATIC
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )

    # Set include directories for shared lib
    dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "my_shared_lib" SET
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )
    # Is more or less equivalent to:
    target_include_directories(my_shared_lib
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )

    # Set include directories for static lib
    dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "my_static_lib" SET
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )
    # Is more or less equivalent to:
    target_include_directories(my_static_lib
      INTERFACE
          "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
          "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )

  This example sets ``my_shared_lib`` and ``my_static_lib`` to expose:

  * ``${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib`` during the build.
  * ``<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/include/mylib`` after installation (where
    ``<CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>`` is resolved when imported via :command:`dependency(EXPORT)`).

.. signature::
  dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION <lib-target-name> [CONFIGURATION <config-type>] INTERFACE <gen-expr>...)

  Set the :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG> <cmake:prop_tgt:IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>>` property of the imported
  target ``<lib-target-name>`` using generator expressions to provide the
  full path to the library file. The name should represent the base name of
  the library (without prefix or suffix).

  This command is intended for targets that have been previously declared
  using :command:`dependency(IMPORT)`, and is typically used in conjunction
  with :command:`dependency(EXPORT)` to complete the definition of
  an imported target for external reuse. It allows specifying a different
  location for each build configuration type, or for all configurations
  if no configuration is specified. It fills in target properties that
  are used when generating the export script. Therefore, there is no benefit
  in calling it if the target is not intended to be exported.

  If ``CONFIGURATION`` is given (``DEBUG``, ``RELEASE``, etc.), the property is
  only set for that configuration. Otherwise, the property is set for all
  configurations supported by the target. Configuration types must match one of
  the values listed in the target's :cmake:prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS <cmake:prop_tgt:IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS>` property.

  The ``INTERFACE`` keyword must be followed by one or more generator
  expressions that define the path to the library file during build and install
  phases. The paths following it **must use generator expressions** like
  ``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>`` and ``$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>`` to distinguish
  between build and install phases. (see
  `how write build specification with generator expressions <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#build-specification-with-generator-expressions>`__).

  These expressions are evaluated to determine the value of the following
  CMake properties set by this command:

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>``
      The full path to the actual library file (e.g. ``.so``, ``.dll``, ``.a``, ``.lib``),
      set separately for each configuration (``RELEASE`` and/or ``DEBUG``).
      See the `CMake doc <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/IMPORTED_LOCATION.html>`__ for full details. The command :command:`directory(FIND_LIB)` can be used to find the library file.

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_BUILD_<CONFIG>``
      *Custom property* set to the full path to the actual library file,
      set separately for each configuration (``RELEASE`` and/or ``DEBUG``),
      and for usage from the build-tree context. This property is used by
      :command:`dependency(EXPORT)` to complete the definition of an imported
      target for external reuse.

    ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_INSTALL_<CONFIG>``
      *Custom property* set to the full path to the actual library file,
      set separately for each configuration (``RELEASE`` and/or ``DEBUG``),
      and for usage from the install-tree context.  This property is used by
      :command:`dependency(EXPORT)` to complete the definition of an imported
      target for external reuse.

  .. note::

    The ``dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION)`` command should be called after
    importing the target with :command:`dependency(IMPORT)` to ensure that
    the target properties and result variables are set correctly.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    # Import libs
    dependency(IMPORT "my_shared_lib"
      TYPE SHARED
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )
    dependency(IMPORT "my_static_lib"
      TYPE STATIC
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )

    # Set imported location for shared lib
    dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION "my_shared_lib"
      CONFIGURATION RELEASE
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/mylib_1.11.0.dll>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:lib/mylib_1.11.0.dll>"
    )
    dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION "my_shared_lib"
      CONFIGURATION DEBUG
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/mylibd_1.11.0.dll>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:lib/mylibd_1.11.0.dll>"
    )

    # Set include directories for static lib
    dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION "my_static_lib"
      CONFIGURATION RELEASE
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/mylib_1.11.0.lib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:lib/mylib_1.11.0.lib>"
    )
    dependency(SET_IMPORTED_LOCATION "my_static_lib"
      CONFIGURATION DEBUG
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/mylibd_1.11.0.lib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:lib/mylibd_1.11.0.lib>"
    )

.. signature::
  dependency(EXPORT <lib-target-name>... <BUILD_TREE|INSTALL_TREE> [APPEND] OUTPUT_FILE_NAME <file-name>)

  Creates a file ``<file-name>`` in :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR <cmake:variable:CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR>`
  that may be included by outside projects to import targets in
  ``<lib-target-name>`` list from the current project's build-tree or install
  -tree. This command is functionally similar to using
  :cmake:command:`export(TARGETS) <cmake:command:export(targets)>` in a ``BUILD_TREE`` context and :cmake:command:`install(EXPORT) <cmake:command:install(export)>`
  in an ``INSTALL_TREE`` context, but is designed specifically to export
  imported targets with :command:`dependency(IMPORT)` instead of build targets.

  The targets in ``<lib-target-name>`` list  must be previously created imported
  targets. The names should match exactly the target names used during import.

  One of ``BUILD_TREE`` or ``INSTALL_TREE`` must be specified to indicate the
  context in which the file is generated:

  * When ``BUILD_TREE`` is used, the command generates the file in
    ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/<file-name>``, similar to how :cmake:command:`export(TARGETS) <cmake:command:export(targets)>`
    produces a file to be included by other build projects. This file enables
    other projects to import the specified targets directly from the build-tree
    . It can be included from a ``<PackageName>Config.cmake`` file to provide
    usage information for downstream projects.

  * When ``INSTALL_TREE`` is used, the file is generated in
    ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/cmake/export/<file-name>`` and an install rule
    is added to copy the file to ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/cmake/export/
    <file-name>``. This is similar to combining :cmake:command:`install(TARGETS) <cmake:command:install(targets)>` with
    :cmake:command:`install(EXPORT) <cmake:command:install(export)>`, but applies to imported rather than built targets.
    This makes the export file available post-install and allows downstream
    projects to include the file from a package configuration file.

  Note that no install rules are created for the actual binary files of the
  imported targets; only the export script ``OUTPUT_FILE_NAME`` itself is installed.

  If the ``APPEND`` keyword is specified, the generated code is appended to the
  existing file instead of overwriting it. This is useful for exporting
  multiple targets incrementally to a single file.

  The generated file defines all necessary target properties so that the
  imported targets can be used as if they were defined locally. The properties
  are identical to those set by the :command:`dependency(IMPORT)` command; see
  its documentation for additional details.

  .. note::

    The ``dependency(EXPORT)`` command should be called after importing the
    target with :command:`dependency(IMPORT)` to ensure that the target
    properties and result variables are set correctly.

  Example usage:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    # Import libs before exporting
    dependency(IMPORT "my_shared_lib"
      TYPE SHARED
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )
    dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "my_shared_lib" SET
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )
    dependency(IMPORT "my_static_lib"
      TYPE STATIC
      FIND_ROOT_DIR "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/lib"
      FIND_RELEASE_FILE "mylib_1.11.0"
      FIND_DEBUG_FILE "mylibd_1.11.0"
    )
    dependency(ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "my_static_lib" SET
      INTERFACE
        "$<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>"
        "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>"
    )

    # Export from Build-Tree
    dependency(EXPORT "my_shared_lib" "my_static_lib"
      BUILD_TREE
      OUTPUT_FILE_NAME "InternalDependencyTargets.cmake"
    )
    # Is more or less equivalent to:
    export(TARGETS "my_shared_lib" "my_static_lib"
      APPEND
      FILE "InternalDependencyTargets.cmake"
    )

    # Exporting from Install-Tree
    set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/install")
    dependency(EXPORT "my_shared_lib" "my_static_lib"
      INSTALL_TREE
      OUTPUT_FILE_NAME "InternalDependencyTargets.cmake"
    )
    # Is more or less equivalent to:
    install(TARGETS "my_shared_lib" "my_static_lib"
      EXPORT "LibExport"
    )
    install(EXPORT "LibExport"
      DESTINATION "cmake/export"
      FILE "InternalDependencyTargets.cmake"
    )

  The resulting file ``InternalDependencyTargets.cmake`` may then be included
  by a package configuration file ``<PackageName>Config.cmake.in`` to be used by
  :cmake:command:`configure_package_config_file() <cmake:command:configure_package_config_file>` command:
